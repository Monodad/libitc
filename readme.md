# libitc

VHDL library for 108th and 109th ITC hardware. Current version is v3.

## Supported hardwares

Under `src/`, every hardware have its own `.vhd` file, consists of one package, which can have one or more constants and components.

## Utilities

Under `src/util`, there are shared dependency used by multiple files for converting types, generating waves, etc.

|   Name   |                For                |  Status   |
| :------: | :-------------------------------: | :-------: |
|   clk    |       System clock dividers       |  working  |
|   edge   |           Edge detector           |  working  |
| debounce |   Push button/switch debouncer    |  working  |
|   pwm    | Single phase PWM signal generator |  working  |
|   i2c    |       IÂ²C master interface        | debugging |
|   spi    |   SPI simplex master interface    | debugging |
|   uart   |          UART interface           | debugging |

## Tests

There are no actual complete VHDL testbench, but there some .vhd files located under `tests/` you can `Set as top level entity` in Quartus to test some of the packages.

## Tools

Under `tools/` there are scripts that help with the writing of the code.
